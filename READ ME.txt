This is a SCSS file made to work with Drupal 7 CSS in conjuction with using the Mothership theme (https://www.drupal.org/project/mothership).
This allows for an easy starting point for modern styling of Drupal 7 sites.
It is based around responsiveness and CSS variables to allow for ease of use when creating a new site.
I personally use a local compiler with VSCode called Live Sass Compiler (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass). There's multiple compilers you can easily find online or download locally as well.  I have converted the base file already to CSS as well, however I have also created a simple compiler you can use as well and set up the files to use it easily.

To use the SCSS to CSS compiler:
1. Use a command line to run the compiler.
2. Navigate to the folder with the compiler in the command prompt.
3. Run command "npm install node-sass" without the quotes to install the Sass node.
4. While in the folder, use command "npm run scss" without the quotes.

If you run into issues with the compiler, you may need to install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/).
